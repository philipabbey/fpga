# FPGA Projects

These projects are typically explained through a [personal blog site](http://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/).

## VHDL

Ideas explored for creating VLSI logic with VHDL.

## TCL

Ideas for driving FPGA tools which typically use TCL for automation, E.g. Siemens ModelSim simulation tool, and both Xilinx's Vivado and Intel's Quartus Prime synthesis tools.

## Operating Systems

Intended for any code relating to shells. Presently just automated Cygwin installation methods.
