## Sychroniser

1. Implementing dynamic timing checks for a standard clock domain crossing solution. The dynamic check is to verify that the data in the source clock domain remains stable for at least 2 samplings by the destination clock.

Please read the blog post [Dynamic Timing Check For A Standard Clock Domain Crossing Solution](https://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/dynamic-timing-check-for-a-standard-clock-domain) for an explanation of how the code works in detail.


2. Two synchronisers [taught by Doulos](https://www.doulos.com/webinars/on-demand/clock-domain-crossing/) coded and examined.

1. CDC for Registers
2. CDC for Counters

Please read the blog post [Doulos Clock Domain Crossing Material](https://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/doulos-clock-domain-crossing-material) for an explanation of how the code works in detail.
