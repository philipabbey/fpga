## Sychroniser

Implementing dynamic timing checks for a standard clock domain crossing solution. The dynamic check is to verify that the data in the source clock domain remains stable for at least 2 samplings by the destination clock.

Please read the blog post [Dynamic Timing Check For A Standard Clock Domain Crossing Solution](https://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/dynamic-timing-check-for-a-standard-clock-domain) for an explanation of how the code works in detail.
