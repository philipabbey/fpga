## Large Barrel Shift Pipelined by Iteration or Recursion

Creating an excessively large barrel shift component that is arbitraily pipelined. Both the iterative and tail recursive implementations are explored for comparison.


## Compilation

1. Compile VHDL library [local](../Local) if you have not already done so.
2. Run the [modelsim_compile.cmd](modelsim_compile.cmd) Windows batch file.

Assumes the following directory already exists and hence will fail to compile if it does not. Amend to suit your needs.

```batch
set SIM=%USERPROFILE%\ModelSim
```
