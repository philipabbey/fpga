## Large Multiplexer Pipelined by Recursion

Creating an excessively multiplexer component that is arbitraily pipelined using an n-ary tree via recursive instantiation.


## Compilation

1. Compile VHDL library [local](../Local) if you have not already done so.
2. Run the [modelsim_compile.cmd](modelsim_compile.cmd) Windows batch file.

Assumes the following directory already exists and hence will fail to compile if it does not. Amend to suit your needs.

```batch
set SIM=%USERPROFILE%\ModelSim
```
