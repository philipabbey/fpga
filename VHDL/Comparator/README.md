Recursive structures in hardware description languages were not new when I first created this solution prior to 2004. This problem amused me because I wanted to create a structure in VHDL that Synplify Pro could not improve on to know that I had created something optimal. A simple example would be a recursive RAM, consuming a number of bits of address space with each level of recursion. But the point of recursion is to pipeline logic at each level to achieve a required clock speed. The example I have played with here is an _n_-bit comparator.

Please read the blog post [Large Comparators Pipelined Efficiently by Recursion](https://blog.abbey1.org.uk/index.php/technology/large-comparator-pipelined-efficiently-by-recursion) for an explanation of how the code works in detail.

## Compilation

1. Compile VHDL library [local](../Local) if you have not already done so.
2. Run the [modelsim_compile.cmd](modelsim_compile.cmd) Windows batch file.

Assumes the following directory already exists and hence will fail to compile if it does not. Amend to suit your needs.

```batch
set SIM=%USERPROFILE%\ModelSim
```
